Fast Evolution Computing for Synthesizer Parameter Finding


This was my final year thesis in univeristy that tries to use an Evolutionary Agorithm to best find the paramaters for sytnthesizing sounds. In this project, musical instruments are used for the sounds and we test different algorithms to find these sounds and synthesize without any human input.
